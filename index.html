<h1>My First Web Page</h1>
  <body>
  Hello, my name is Zoe and I'm creating this web page for a class assignment.
<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<body> 
<p>In my free time, I like to watch movies, listen to music, read, write, and sketch. I'm not the most competitive person in the world, but that doesn't mean I don't enjoy being physically active. I spend a lot of time playing with my dogs, taking hikes, and archery.<br> I find these hobbies strengthen both my body and my mind.</p>
<h2>Interests</h2>
<body>
<p>I <em>love</em> horror and anything that has to do with superheroes. My all-time favorite superhero is Spider-Man. I admire Spider-Man's sympathy and compassion; how he shows genuine concern for his enemies and risks his life to protect the city, free of charge, despite their hatred of him.<br> That's the kind of person I aspire to be.</p>
